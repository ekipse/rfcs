# Eject Messaging

Add some jovial messaging when a Spike site is ejected 

Something like: 
- "You're on your own"
- "You've got this!"
- "I hope you know what you're doing"
- "Well, bye"
- "Good luck!"

Followed by actual helpful information on what just happened to your files during the ejection and what should be done next (or link to docs).

## Scope

#### Minimally:

- add ASCII or ANSI art messaing when someone ejects a Spike site


#### Optionally:

- use [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) for rainbow text, etc
- Play [a sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uKIeamPi2Y)


## Value

While Spike is a helpful tool, we dont want to take ourselves too seriously. A perfect place for this is during the eject message. We want to reinforce the notion that once a site is ejected, developers are on their own. Perhaps by  addig a little humor, it will help ease the blow of this "harsh" message.


## Risks & Rabbit Holes

- Spending more time on this that actual Spike functionality
- Wanting to add this type of messaging everywhere
